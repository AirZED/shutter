# Creator Monetization Guide - Shutter Platform

## üé® Vision

Shutter is a multi-chain NFT platform that enables creators to monetize their content through NFT-gated access. Creators can upload multimedia content to decentralized storage (Walrus) and mint NFTs that grant access to their premium content.

## üöÄ How It Works

### For Creators

1. **Upload Your Content**
   - Select images, videos, or other media files
   - Preview your content before uploading
   - Content is stored on Walrus (decentralized storage)

2. **Mint Access NFTs**
   - Choose between Sui or Solana blockchain
   - Set access tiers (public, premium, exclusive)
   - Mint NFTs that gate access to your content
   - Set royalties for secondary sales

3. **Earn Revenue**
   - **Primary Sales**: Earn when users mint your NFTs
   - **Secondary Sales**: Earn royalties when NFTs are resold
   - **Access Control**: Premium content only accessible to NFT holders

### For Collectors

1. **Discover Content**
   - Browse galleries with preview images
   - See what content is locked behind NFTs
   - View required NFTs and traits

2. **Mint NFTs for Access**
   - Connect your wallet (Phantom for Solana, Sui Wallet for Sui)
   - Mint the required NFT
   - Automatically gain access to premium content

3. **View Protected Content**
